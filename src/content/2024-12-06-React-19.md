preview: dive deep into the new features of React 19 and how it improves the integration with Web Components.

React 19 has just been released on 5 December 2024 and brings with it many new features and improvements, each of which is very exciting, but I'd like to focus your attention on one of them:

> Support for Custom Elements

It's no secret that Web Components support in React has been a much-anticipated feature. Issue [#11347](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11347) about properties/attributes support for custom elements in React was created in October 2017 (seven years ago!), but the React team explained that they didn't want to rush and make quick decisions that they would regret later.

> We'd be happy to support WCs better in React. We don't want to rush it, and want to make sure this support is well thought-out.

Component libraries using Web Components have needed to create special React wrappers due to integration challenges between the technologies. For example, Microsoft created [@microsoft/fast-react-wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/fast-react-wrapper) for their FAST component library, while Adobe developed wrappers for their Adobe Spectrum library under the [@swc-react](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/using-swc-react/) scope.

But finally, thanks for efforts from [josepharhar](https://github.com/josepharhar) for driving design and implementation, React developers can work with Web Components without any wrappers.

## What was not great with Web Components in React 18?

The React team briefly mentioned that previously React treated all unknown properties as attributes. This created a significant issue because HTML attributes can only have string values. To pass an object, developers had to either use JSON.stringify()/JSON.parse() for data conversion or create a Ref to access the DOM node directly in an imperative style. Most developers opted for the Ref approach, but this wasn't ideal—it deviated from React's declarative paradigm and required extra boilerplate code. Unfortunately, using Refs was the only way to work with component properties.

The same applies to CustomEvent support. To attach an event listener to a CustomEvent, you must create a Ref to the WebComponent and interact with the DOM node directly using addEventListener() and removeEventListener().

Finally, there's the matter of how boolean attributes work in HTML. The presence of an attribute means "true," while its absence means "false." Before React 19, this behavior only worked for standard attributes like "disabled." For custom boolean attributes, developers had to create a separate props object, add the attributes that should be "true", and then spread the result object.

It's understandable why library authors chose to encapsulate all this complexity and boilerplate code within wrappers.

Fortunately, React 19 resolves all these issues. Let's create a two React apps with React 18 and React 19 that uses the same web component, "web-counter", and compare.

"web-counter" is a simple component, that has an increment button and displays a current value. It has:

- One boolean attribute, “isdark” that changes the color of the text depending on the current color scheme.
- One property “increment” with type Object, that allows to set up the increment value.
- It emits a CustomEvent “IncrementedEvent” with the current value as a payload.

You can view the complete code here: [web-counter](https://github.com/aleks-elkin/react-web-components/blob/main/packages/web-components/web-counter.js)
I chose vanilla JS for implementation - while this makes the code longer, it ensures pure compatibility with Web Standards.

In the React app, we want to change the color scheme between light and dark, switch the increment value between 1 and 2, and track the total number of button clicks by subscribing to the "IncrementedEvent" CustomEvent.

This is how it will look in the browser:

### Light theme

![Light theme](./light.png)

### Dark theme

![Dark theme](./dark.png)

## How we will work with this component in React 18 app?

Because this web component has a property of the type Object that we need to interact with, we need to create a Ref first, and create a useEffect tto manually update values when the state changes.

```javascript
const counterRef = useRef(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (counterRef.current) {
    counterRef.current.increment = increment;
  }
}, [counterRef, increment]);

<...>
  <web-counter ref={counterRef}></web-counter>
<...>
```

Also, we will use the Ref to subscribe to the CustomEvent to count the clicks.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const node = counterRef.current;
  const addClickCount = () => setClickCount(clickCount + 1);
  if (node) {
    node.addEventListener("IncrementedEvent", addClickCount);
  }
  return () => {
    node.removeEventListener("IncrementedEvent", addClickCount);
  };
}, [counterRef, clickCount]);
```

Finally, since "isdark" is a boolean attribute, we need to create a custom props object to conditionally add or remove this attribute.

```javascript
const props = isDark ? { isDark: true } : {};

<...>
  <web-counter {...props}></web-counter>
<...>
```

## How we will work with this component in React 19 app?

React 19 introduces a new strategy for handling Custom Elements. By default, it checks if a component has a corresponding DOM property — if so, React assigns the value directly to that property. If not, React treats it as an HTML attribute, intelligently handling boolean attributes by adding or removing them as needed. React 19 also adds native support for Custom Events, allowing developers to add event listeners using the familiar "on + CustomEventName" convention, just like standard events such as onClick. So all of the above code needed for React 18 can be simplified in React 19 to:

```javascript
<...>
  <web-counter
    increment={increment}
    isDark={isDark}
    onIncrementedEvent={() => setClickCount(clickCount + 1)}
  ></web-counter>
<...>
```

So, let’s compare, how our code changed thanks to improvements introduced in React 19?

- No need for using Ref and working with the DOM node directly.
- No need for artificial properties object to work with boolean attributes.

## Conclusion

As a developer who has had to work with and support Web components in React, I'm very excited about these changes! If you've already tried Web components in your React apps and Dev Ex didn't feel right, I encourage you to try them again in your next React 19 app!
